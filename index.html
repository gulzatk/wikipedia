                <p>The history of the penny of Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, the period in which the House of Hanover reigned, saw its transformation from a small silver coin to a larger bronze piece. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse. During most of the 18th century, the penny was a small silver coin rarely seen in circulation. Beginning in 1787, the chronic shortage of good money resulted   in the wide circulation of private tokens, including ones valued at one penny. In 1797 Matthew Boulton gained a government contract and struck millions of pennies. The copper penny continued to be issued until 1860, when they were replaced by lighter bronze coins; the "Bun penny", named for the hairstyle of Queen Victoria on it, was issued from then until 1894. The final years of her reign saw the "Old head" pennies, coined from 1895 until her death in 1901. (Full article...)</p><br>

                 <p>Nineteen women have served as cabinet ministers in governments of the Republic of Ireland and its predecessors the Irish Free State and the Irish Republic. The Government of Ireland is the cabinet that exercises executive authority in the Republic of Ireland. After a 58-year gap between the first and second women ministers, there has been at least one woman in all cabinets since December 1982. No woman has ever been Taoiseach (prime minister), but four women have served as Tánaiste (deputy prime minister). The 31st Government of Ireland was formed in June 2017. As of April 2018 it includes four women as ministers in the cabinet of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: Heather Humphreys, Katherine Zappone, Regina Doherty and Josepha Madigan. No more than four women have served simultaneously in any cabinet, and a 2014 pledge by the then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny to create a gender-balanced cabinet remains unfulfilled. (Full list...)</p><br>

                  <p>Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) was an English painter. Along with his bitter rival, Sir Joshua Reynolds, he is considered one of the most important British portrait artists of the second half of the 18th century. Born and raised in Sudbury, Suffolk, Gainsborough lived in London during the 1740s, where he trained under engraver Hubert-François Gravelot and contributed to the decoration of Vauxhall Gardens. After marrying Margaret Burr, an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Beaufort, Gainsborough moved back to Sudbury and then to Ipswich, Bath and London. Gainsborough was a fast painter and worked more from observations of nature than from application of formal academic rules. Despite being a prolific portrait painter, Gainsborough gained greater satisfaction from his landscapes.

                      This painting is a self-portrait of Gainsborough, painted shortly before he moved from Ipswich to Bath in 1759. It is now in the National Portrait Gallery in London.
